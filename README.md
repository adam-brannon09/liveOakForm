# Live Oak Contact Request Form

## Description
Welcome to the Live Oak Fiber Contact Form â€“ a user-friendly solution designed to facilitate seamless communication between potential customers and our team. This web application simplifies the process of capturing vital information for individuals and businesses interested in our services.

Users can effortlessly input their details, including their name and contact information. Additionally, the form accommodates personalized messages, allowing individuals to convey specific preferences or inquiries. The flexibility extends to distinguishing between business and residential accounts, and users can express interest in a particular package or choose "Not Sure" for dedicated assistance from our sales representatives.

Behind the scenes, the data collected is securely transmitted and stored in a Firestore database. This integration allows our sales team to efficiently monitor and manage incoming requests. The captured information is then intelligently distributed to the relevant sales representatives, ensuring a prompt and personalized follow-up with potential clients.

## Installation

No install required for the web-based version. To run the application locally, clone the repository to your local machine

## Usage

To use the web-based version simply navigate to the deployed application [URL](https://live-oak-form.vercel.app/) and begin using the app in your browser.
 
 For general inquiries a prospective customer will fill out all required information on the form and click submit. The collected information is sent to a leads collection in the Firestore Database to later be viewed and assigned to the sales team by the Sales Manager.

 The form has been updated with new functionality to allow for sales reps to receive inquiries from leads they work in the market. The url simply needs to be altered to use the rep's name as the endpoint, for example: www.liveoakform.com/repsName. This will send the captured information to a collection in the Firestore Database that the rep can view in their own personal [dashboard](https://github.com/adam-brannon09/lofmanagerdashboard).
